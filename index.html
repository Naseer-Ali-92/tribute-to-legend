                    most runs in both Test and ODI, and the only player to complete more than 30,000 runs in

                        Tendulkar is a practising Hindu. He is a devotee of the deity Ganesha and was a
                        disciple of the guru Sathya Sai Baba of Puttaparthi, whom he visited on several occasions. In
                        1997, Tendulkar captained the Indian National side, playing against a World Eleven team, in the
                        Unity Cup which was held at the Sri Sathya Sai Hill View Stadium in Puttaparthi, in Baba's
                        presence.The death of Sai Baba on Tendulkar's 38th birthday caused him to cancel his
                        celebrations.The cricketer is also known to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi at home and frequently
                        visits temples during night when it is calm and quiet.
